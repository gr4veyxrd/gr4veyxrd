â˜¾ hey! *if you're not from ponytown, feel free to ignore this.*

i'm gr4ve, so call me grave. i use github for creating issues on the projects that i use, but this also functions as my ponytown bio. </p>

- legal adult
- interests are varied
- i will know of possibly anything you know of. challenge me
- friends are few, and i like to get very close with people i like
- **C + H** is ok, but please talk to me beforehand
- if i talk to you and you prefer **w2i**, i have no problem switching
- i wander and typically stick with friends, and i almost exclusively live on 18+
- if you are a minor*, i would prefer that you not interact (or at the very least not try to add me or talk to me long term.)
- *if you are a minor on the 18+ server, do not interact under any circumstance as i will assume you are 18+ a majority of the time.

a lot of the ponies i make are self inserts or kins, but a few of them are f/os or characters i like a lot.
i will always use the formula

**Character name** \\\ (or //) **Source material** - **int or dni** 

some of my current interests as of the last commit are:
- Limbus Company
- Project Zomboid
- Fortnite

but other ones of note are Homestuck, Deltarune and LoL (lore and game)
